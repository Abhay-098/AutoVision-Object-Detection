# 🚗 AutoVision – Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles

## 📘 Project Overview
AutoVision is a deep learning-based project designed to detect and classify real-world objects such as cars, pedestrians, traffic lights, and signs — essential for autonomous driving systems. The project uses object detection algorithms to enhance road awareness and safety.

This is **Week 1** of the project, focusing on setting up the repository, dataset preparation, and base code initialization.
